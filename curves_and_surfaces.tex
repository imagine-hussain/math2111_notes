\section{Curves and Surfaces}
\subsection{Curves}
\paragraph{Curves}
A curve in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector function
\[\mathbf{c}: I \to\mathbb{R}^n,\]
where \(I\) is an interval in \(\mathbb{R}\).

\paragraph{Forms / Notations}
Curves may be defined in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parametrically} by \(c(t) = \left(x_1(t), x_2(t), \dots, x_n(t)\right)\)
    \item \textbf{Cartesian} by eliminating the \(t\) variable to get \(y\) in terms of \(x\)
    \item \textbf{Implicitly} As \(F(x, y) = 0\).
\end{itemize}
