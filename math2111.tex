    \section{Curves and Surfaces}
    \subsection{Curves}
    \paragraph{Curves}
    A curve in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector function
    \[\mathbf{c}: I \to\mathbb{R}^n,\]
    where \(I\) is an interval in \(\mathbb{R}\).

    \paragraph{Forms / Notations}
    Curves may be defined in the following ways:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Parametrically} by \(c(t) = \left(x_1(t), x_2(t), \dots, x_n(t)\right)\)
        \item \textbf{Cartesian} by eliminating the \(t\) variable to get \(y\) in terms of \(x\)
        \item \textbf{Implicitly} As \(F(x, y) = 0\).
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Analysis}

    \subsection{Assumed}
    \paragraph{Assumed Concepts from Real Single-Variable Calculus}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item limits
        \item continuity
        \item differentiability
        \item integrability
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Assumed Theorems}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Min/ Max Theorem
        \item Intermediate Value Theorem
        \item Mean Value Theorem
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Limits}
    Recall that \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L\) requires that for all
    \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that
    if \(|x-a| < \delta\)
    then
    \[|f(x) - L|  < \delta.\]
    
    
    
    \subsection{Metrics}
    We have metrics (distance functions) as
    \[m: \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\]
    satisfying the following 3 axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Positive Definite} such that for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n\),
        \(m(x,y) > 0\) and, \(m(x,y) = 0\ \Leftrightarrow x = y\).
        \item \textbf{Symmetric} \(m(x,y) = m(y, x)\).z
        \item \textbf{Triangle Inequality} such that for all \(x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}^n\),
        \(m(x,y) + m(y, z) \leq m(x, z)\).
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Euclidian Distance}
    We allow the Euclidian distance to be defined as
    \[d_n(x,y) := ||x-y|| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_y)^2}\]
    We often allow \(d\) to be \(d_2\).

    \paragraph{Norms} Norms will be revisited in the Fourier Series section. They can be thought of as the length of an element in vectors space.

    \paragraph{Equivalent Metrics}
    Two metrics \(d\) and \(\delta\) are considered equal if 
    there exists constants \(0 < c < C < \infty\) such that
    \[ c\delta (x,y) \leq d(x,y) \leq C \delta(x, y).\]
    
    \subsection{Limits of Sequences}

    \paragraph{Balls} A ball around \(\vec{a}\in \mathbb{R} \) is of radius \( \epsilon \) is the set
    \[B(\vec{a}, \epsilon), = \{x\in \mathbb{R} : d(\vec{a}, x) < \epsilon\}.\]
    
    \paragraph{Limit in Sequence} 
    For a sequence \( \{x_i\} \) of points in \( \mathbb{R}^n \),
    \(x\) is the limit of the sequence if and only if 
    \[\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \text{ such that } n \geq N \implies d(x, x_n) \leq \epsilon. \]
    Equivalently,
    \[\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \text{ such that } n \geq N \implies d(x, x_n) \in B(x, \epsilon).\]

    \paragraph{Theorems with Limits of Sequences}
    \begin{align*}
        \text{A sequence \(x_k\) converges to a limit \(x\)}\\
        &\Leftrightarrow \text{The components of \(x_k\)} \\
        & \quad \text{converge to the componetents of \(x\)} \\
        & \Leftrightarrow d(x_k, x) \rightarrow 0.
    \end{align*}

    \paragraph{Limits and Equivalent Metrics}
    Suppose that \(d\) and \(\delta\) are two equivalent metrics.
    That is, \(cd(x,y) \leq \delta (x, y) \leq Cd(x,y)\) for \(c, C > 0\).

    Considering \(d\) as the metric, suppose that 
    \[x_k \to x\quad\text{ for } x_k, x \in\mathbb{R}^n.\]
    That is,
    \[\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists K : k \geq K \implies d(x_k, x) < \epsilon.\]
    Using \(\delta\), we may make an equivalent statement, choosing
    \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(\epsilon' = C\epsilon\).
    Considering that \(e > 0 \implies \exists K : \forall k \geq K
    \implies d(x_k, x) < \epsilon\) then, 
    \[\delta (x_k, x) \leq Cd (x_k, x) < C\epsilon = \epsilon'.\]
    That is, \(\delta (x_k, x) < \epsilon'.\) Hence \(x_k \to x\)
    using an equivalent metric \(\delta\).

    \paragraph{Cauchy Sequences}
    A sequence \(\{x_K\}\in\mathbb{R}\) is a Cauchy sequence if
    \[
        \exists \epsilon > 0 \text{ such that } k,I > K 
        \implies d(x_k, x_l) < \epsilon.
    \]

    \paragraph{Cauchy Sequences and Convergence}
    The following are equivalent:
    \[
        \text{A sequence \(\{x_k\}\) converges in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)}
        \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
        \text{\(\{x_k\}\) is a Cauchy Sequence}.
    \]
    
    \subsection{Open and Closed Sets}

    \paragraph{Definitions}
    Consider \(x_k \)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(x_0\in\Omega\) is an \underline{interior points} of \(\Omega\) if there is a ball around \(x\) completely contained in \(\Omega\). That is, there exists a \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(B(x_0, \epsilon) \subseteq \Omega\).
        \item  \(\Omega\) is open if every point of \(\Omega\) is an interior point.
        \item \(\Omega\) is closed if its complement is open.
        \item \(x_0\in\Omega\) is a \underline{boundary point} of \(\Omega\) if every ball around \(x_0\) contains points in \(\Omega\) and points not in \(\Omega\).
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Closed Sets}
    A set \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}\) is closed iff and only if it contains all of its boundary points.

    \paragraph{Limit Points and Sets}
    \(x_0\) is a limit point of \(\Omega\) if there is a sequence \(\{x_i\}\) 
    in \(\Omega\) with limit \(x_0\) and \(x_i \neq x\).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every interior points of \(\Omega\) is a limit point of \(\Omega\).
        \item \(x_0\) is not necessarily in \(Omega\)
        \item A set is closed \(\Leftrightarrow\) it contains all of its limit points.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Variations of a Set}
    Consider the set \(\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n\).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \underline{interior} of \(\Omega\) is the set of all its interior points.
        \item The \underline{boundary} \(\partial \Omega)\) of \(\Omega\) is the set of all its boundary points.
        \item The \underline{closure} of \(\Omega\): \(\bar{\Omega} = \Omega \cup \partial \Omega\).
    \end{itemize}
    The interior is the largest open subset and the closure is the smallest closed set containing \(\Omega\).

    \paragraph{Limit of a Function at a Point}
    For \(f: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\), 
    \(\lim_{x\to x_0}\) means that 
    \begin{align*}
        \forall \epsilon \exists \delta > 0\text{ such that for } x\in\Omega: \\
        0 < d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d(f(x), b) < \epsilon.
    \end{align*}
    Alternatively,
    \[
        x\in B(x_0, \delta) \backslash \{x_0\}
        \implies f(x)\in B(b, \epsilon).
    \]
    It is sufficient to consider the limits of the components of a function.

    \paragraph{Limits and sequences}
    The limit \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = b\) exists if and only if,
    \(\lim_{k\to\infty} f(x_k) = b\)  for all sequences \({x_k}\) such that 
    \(x_k\) is an element of \(\Omega\) and,
    \(\lim_{k\to\infty} x_k = a\).
    
    This is very helpful for showing that a limit does not exists.
