## Where to find the notes?

Find the notes in the `.pdf` file. Currently, there are two `.pdf` files. One is the the regular file and the other has been built in dark mode.
If the dark mode looks like it hasn't been updated freely, feel free to run `build_dark.py` by running `python3 build_dark.py` in your terminal after cloning this repo. Note that this will require you to have a latex compiler installed.

One of these days I should add automatic building to the pipeline on pushes but if you're seeing this, then clearly that has not happened yet.


### Issues / Mistakes

While I do my best to keep these notes accurate, sometimes typos and mistakes slip through. Feel to create corrections as a pull request, or point out mistakes in `issues`.
